The codebase implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with various player strategies. It includes a `Board` class representing the game board, a `Game` class managing the game flow, and different player classes: `RandomPlayer` making random moves, `MinMaxPlayer` using the minimax algorithm to find the optimal move, `TQPlayer` learning from experience using a Q-table, and `NNPlayer` and `NN2Player` using neural networks to learn optimal strategies. The codebase also includes test cases for each player and the game logic.
